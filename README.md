Welcome and thank you for trying out my Habit tracker.

On the github page https://github.com/GD-DSir/Habit_Tracker.git click the code dropdown button. Click on download zip and wait for download to finish.
Once finished head to the downloads folder and extract the contents of the zip file.

To run the program head to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the python package for your operating system.

Head to the folder containing readme.md and tracker.py
If using Windows click on the Explorer adress bar in the folder and type cmd. This will run the cmd terminal. In the terminal type: py tracker.py

The program should run and habits.json file should now exist inside of the directory.
