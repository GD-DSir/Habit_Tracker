Welcome and thank you for trying out my Habit tracker.

On the github page https://github.com/GD-DSir/Habit_Tracker.git click the code dropdown button. Click on download zip and wait for download to finish.
Once finished head to the downloads folder and extract the contents of the zip file.

Alternatively if you have git installed the code can be cloned using https://github.com/GD-DSir/Habit_Tracker.git as the source directory. (Option 1 is recommended as it requires no additional installations)  

To run the program head to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the python package for your operating system.

Head to the extracted folder containing readme.md and tracker.py
If using Windows click on the Explorer adress bar in the folder and type cmd. This will run the cmd terminal. In the terminal type: py tracker.py

An example habits.json file is included, the file can be deleted or habits removed via the interface.
